We define an algorithm in a method as a series fo steps ( method calls )
and provide a chance for subclasses to define or redefine some of these steps.

This pattern allows you to defer implementation of parts of your algorithm which can vary or change

Pattern works by defining abstract methods which then have to be implemented by concrete subclasses.
These methods are like hooks which are then called by template methods.
