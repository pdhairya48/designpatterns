practice.Mediator encapsulates how a set of objects interact with each other. Due to this encapsulation there is
a loose coupling between the interacting objects.

Typically an object explicitly knows about other object to which it wants to interact i.e. to call a method.
In mediator pattern this interaction is within the mediator object & interacting objects only know about the
mediator object.
