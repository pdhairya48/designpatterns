Structural Design Pattern

1. Using bridge pattern, we can decouple implementation & abstraction so they can both change without affecting each other
2. We achieve this feat by creating two separate inheritance hierarchies; one for implementation and another for abstraction.

Implement a bridge

=> abstraction (has a)----- implementor { abstraction may use methods of implementor to do it's task }
=> client (has a) abstraction
