1. We need to provide a placeholder or surrogate to another object.
2. proxy acts on behalf of the object and is used for lots of reasons some of the main reasons are :
    a. Protection proxy - control access to original object's operation
    b. remote proxy - provides a local representation of remote object
    c. virtual proxy - delays construction of original object until abs. necessary


Dynamic Proxy
1. We start by implementing InvocationHandler
Invocation Handler implements invoke method which is called to handle every method invocation on proxy.
2. We need to take action as per method invoked. WE'll cache the method instances on image interface so that we can compare them
inside invoke method
3. Our invocation handler will accept same argument in constructor as needed by constructor or real object.
